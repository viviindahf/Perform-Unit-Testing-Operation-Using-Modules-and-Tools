## Argumen and Parameter
there are two types of arguments:
- Positional Arguments, namely arguments other than the keyword argument. 
- Keyword Arguments, namely arguments that are accompanied by an identifier or parameter name that is explicitly stated.

## Anonymous Function (Lambda)
It is called an anonymous function because it is not given a name at the time it is defined. Lambda functions can have many arguments, but can only have one expression. It is the expression that is returned as the result of the function.

# Method
A method is a special function that belongs to an object, namely the result of instantiation of a class.

## Class Method
Classmethod must have a reference to the class object as the first parameter. When this method is called, we pass the class as the first argument instead of an instance of that class (as we usually do with methods). 

## Static Method
When this method is called, we don't pass an instance of the class to it (as we usually do with methods).

# Open, Read, Close, Delete File in Phyton
## Open File
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file

## Read File
You can return one line by using the readline() method

## Close File
Python file method close() closes the opened file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. 

## Delete File
To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function

# Operating Using Modules and Tools
## I/o
Python io module allows us to manage the file-related input and output operations.

## Os.path
The os.path module contains functions that deal with long filenames (pathnames) in various ways.To use this module, import the os module, and access this module as os.path.
 
## Pydoc
The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules. It can be executed using the pydoc command (or, equivalently, python -m pydoc), followed by the name of the module or script file.

## Unittest
Unittest is a software testing process that ensures every unit/function of the program is tested.

## Sys
This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

## OS
This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system.

## Random Library
This module is an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers.

## Math
This module provides access to the mathematical functions was defined.

## Datetime
The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object.
